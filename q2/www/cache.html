<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>
 A Browser's Cache is used to store some information locally on
 you harddrive rather than online. This is done because
 loading things locally from a drive is faster than from the internet.
 The first time you load up a site it will donwload some basic things
 such as it's favicon onto your computer for quicker access. When using
 MailChimp, once the form appears for the first time it will download a file into the user's
 Browser Cache saying that they have seen the pop up before. If you delete your
 Cache, you delete that file meaning the next time you load up a site the MailChimp
 Form will appear once again.
